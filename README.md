Peaky-DDOS Tool

Warning: This tool is for entertainment purposes only! (Just kidding, don't use it for anything nefarious)

Description: Unleash your inner Tommy Shelby and take down your enemies (or not, we don't condone that sort of thing) with our totally-not-illegal DDoS tool!

Features:

- Totally fictional and not-at-all-effective DDoS attacks
- Whimsical animations to make you feel like a proper Peaky Blinder
- A pretend "Take Down" button that does absolutely nothing (we promise!)

Instructions:

1. Don't actually use this tool for anything.
2. Pretend you're a Peaky Blinder and have a cup of tea instead.
3. If you're feeling mischievous, play a prank on your friend (but not a mean one, we don't condone that either)
